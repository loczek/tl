# Proxies

## Current

Without a proxy only one app per ip and port can be launched.

The current uess `traefik` as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It's not the best option in terms of performance, but it's the easiest to setup.

## Alternatives

The prefered choice for would be to use `nginx` or `haproxy` but the setup seems more complicated
